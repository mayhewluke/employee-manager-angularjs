  Welcome to the Employee Manager demo app! Please note that this app is
  designed as an analogue to
  <a href="https://github.com/mayhewluke/employee-manager-react-native">
    mayhewluke/employee-manager-react-native
  </a>, and as such is designed to mimic a mobile screen <b>when viewed on a
  desktop/laptop</b>. Your experience while on a mobile device may vary.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Use any credentials to log in - if the user does not exist it will be created.
  Firebase will reject the creation in a few circumstances - if the email is
  invalid or password isn't long enough, for example. If you encounter any
  trouble, give "test@example.com" a try with a password of "password".
